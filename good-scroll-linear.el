;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements an algorithm for `good-scroll'
;; that linearly interpolates the position in pixel lines.
;; It's older, simpler, and feels less smooth than `good-scroll-bezier'.
;; Set `good-scroll-algorithm' to `good-scroll-linear' to enable.

;;; Code:

(defun good-scroll-linear (fraction-done)
  "Linear scrolling algorithm.
Return the next position in pixel lines when the scroll is FRACTION-DONE done.
This works by linearly interpolating position."
  (round (- (* fraction-done
               (+ good-scroll-traveled
                  good-scroll-destination))
            good-scroll-traveled)))

(provide 'good-scroll-linear)
